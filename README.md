This project aims to design an advanced car parking management system leveraging IoT technology. It utilizes sensors to detect vehicle presence in parking slots, a microcontroller to process data, and a cloud-based platform to store and manage information. Users can access real-time parking availability through a mobile or web application. The system also includes features like automated entry/exit logging, efficient space allocation, and data analytics to optimize parking space utilization. By reducing human intervention and minimizing congestion, this solution offers a smart and convenient approach to modern parkingÂ challenges.
